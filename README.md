#### This Repository contains the functions of calculating Polynoimial Regression, Linear Regression and Exponential Regression 

### 1. Polynomial Regression: 
"Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial."[1]

### 2. Linear Regression: 
"In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression."[2]

### 3. Exponential Regression:
"An exponential regression is the process of finding the equation of the exponential function that fits best for a set of data. As a result, we get an equation of the form y=abx where aâ‰ 0 . The relative predictive power of an exponential model is denoted by R2." [3]
